# quadratic-probing-hashing-project
a structure representing student information consisting of the following:

    Student name
    Student ID (integer)
    Student date of birth in 3 integers (day, month, year)
    Student score of last year (integer)

we used a hash function that maps the data to the hash table using student's day of birth by making day%table size

We developed functions to insert, delete, find an element in the hash table.
